Assignment 4 Reverse a String

This Java program allows the user to input a string and recieve its reversed version.
The program accepts a string from a user and stores that string within a character array.
A for loop is used to cycle through the array switching the index spots of each character
until the array is completely reversed. Once the array is completely reversed, it is 
transforemed back into a string and printed as the output results to the user.
